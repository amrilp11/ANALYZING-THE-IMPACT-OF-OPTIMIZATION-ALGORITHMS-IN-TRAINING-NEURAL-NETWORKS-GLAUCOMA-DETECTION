# ANALYZING-THE-IMPACT-OF-OPTIMIZATION-ALGORITHMS-IN-TRAINING-NEURAL-NETWORKS-GLAUCOMA-DETECTION
Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness or vision impairment according  to World Health Organization. It requires lot of expertise and practice to detect glaucoma from  the retinal color fundus images. To make it scalable and efficient, various machine Learning  models have been proposed over the years. Our study is aimed at analyzing the impact of  various optimization algorithms and learning rates on training a pre-trained convolutional  neural network model for detecting glaucoma from retinal color fundus images. Six different optimizers were studied with seven different learning rates ranging from 0.0005 to 0.1. The  Experimental results show that there is a significant impact in Loss and Accuracy of the model  with different optimizers and at different learning rates.
